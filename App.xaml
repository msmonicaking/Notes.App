<?Just to keep things simple, both of these files are referred to as a single file. >
    <?There are generally two files with any XAML file, the .xaml file itself, >
    <?and a corresponding code file that is a child item of it in the Solution Explorer. >
    <?The .xaml file contains XAML markup and the code file contains code created by the user to interact with the XAML markup.?>

<?The App.xaml file contains app-wide XAML resources, such as colors, styles, or templates>
